  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\n\nEntry 20: 02.09.2021\r\n\r\nHaven\u2019t taken the
    meds for more than a week now. I\u2019m feeling great, sometimes the dog shows
    up but I tell him to fuck off. Libido is back and through the roof. Rose seems
    a bit down though, but we\u2019re still on the same page about the baby. Hopefully
    we\u2019ll get pregnant soon and the baby will be born after the pandemic is
    over. I can say out loud that I\u2019m at peace, I\u2019ve found balance and
    feel even suddenly wiser. It\u2019s been helping me a lot cause I feel like I
    can be Rose\u2019s safe haven. For the first time she\u2019s been the one who
    comes to me with her afflictions and I am the one who hugs her and tells her
    everything will be fine. I like being this person. I want to protect her.\r\n"
