  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\n\nEntry 19: 26.08.2021\r\n\r\nRose and I had a huge
    fight last night. My libido is still very low and she\u2019s rightfully frustrated.
    She called me names but I can\u2019t blame her. What else can I do? I\u2019m
    seriously thinking about dropping the medication. I used to be so attracted to
    her, now she\u2019s like just a friend. And she\u2019s so insecure about her
    looks, this only makes everything much worse. It\u2019s devastating. I know the
    problem is not her, cause if anything she\u2019s even sexier than ever before.
    This is all on me.\r\n"
