  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\n\nEntry 21: 11.09.2021\r\n\r\nBeen thinking a lot about
    politics. Twenty years ago the attacks on the World Trade Center happened. I
    was very young but remember my brother coming to me and saying that WW3 was about
    to start. I\u2019m getting a bad feeling about the situation in Taiwan. If China
    decides to invade, this might be the beginning of the end. I hope it doesn\u2019t
    come to that, but I certainly don\u2019t trust our politicians to make the best
    decisions. We\u2019ve been electing morons for a long time already.\r\n"
