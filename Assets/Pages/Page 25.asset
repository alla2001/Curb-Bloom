  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\n\nEntryEntry 25: 30.10.21\r\n\r\nThings are getting
    serious with Russia. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being paranoid or not cause
    people don\u2019t care about this at all. Today on the train I was really scared
    and thought people were following the news and knew better than I did. I\u2019m
    just scared and it seems nobody shares this feeling with me. Rose thinks I\u2019m
    insane. I don\u2019t know how to approach her in this matter. Maybe I\u2019m
    really insane. How can I trust my thoughts when they tell me everyone wants to
    kill me? Fuck this, I\u2019m buying my stuff tonight.\r\n"
