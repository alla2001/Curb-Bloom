    Today an asshole at work said he doesn\u2019t like my lack of organization, I
    see he has a point, but I\u2019m so much more productive than this prick! All
    of our projects are finished within the deadlines , I just need sometimes to
    organize my fricking thoughts cause there\u2019s always so much going on! If
    I get fired because of this piece of shit I\u2019m going to throw everything
    on the fan, this pedophile SOAB will get what he\u2019s asking for. I hate working
    from home, have the feeling everyone is talking behind my back.\r\n"
