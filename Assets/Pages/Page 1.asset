  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\r\n\r\nEntry 1: 14.08.2020\r\n\r\n\r\nI am aware of my
    condition and know the importance of the treatment. Even though I don\u2019t
    believe my mood changes so drastically overnight, I see that dr. Khurana means
    well when he says I should keep a diary - it doesn\u2019t cost anything and I
    think it might do even good for my creativity. I don\u2019t remember when was
    the last time I had written on a paper before today. I think that this kind of
    organic activity lightens up my artistic vein, it gives me an injection of inspiration
    to think of myself as a classic writer who can only express his deepest feelings
    through a pen, like Kafka.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been difficult to think of myself
    as a mentally ill person. It has put all my life under a magnifying lens and
    certainly explains a lot. I\u2019ve never been like the others, this much I\u2019ve
    always known for sure. But at the same time, knowing that my behavior and personality
    have been previously described in psychiatric articles and books makes me feel
    less unique\u2026 It\u2019s as if I were a generic lab rat whose actions are
    predictable, because my disease pretty much determines everything that I do,
    even though I\u2019ve always been inclined to think that I simply had a complex
    personality. I don\u2019t know\u2026 it\u2019s sad, but at the same time I don\u2019t
    feel sad. I hope when the black dog shows up again I won\u2019t be having these
    thoughts. As dr. Khurana said, I have to use my knowledge in my favor. If I know
    I\u2019m ill, it might be easier to deal with the dark days when they inevitably
    arrive.\r\n"
