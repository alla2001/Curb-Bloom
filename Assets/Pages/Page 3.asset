  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\n\nEntry 3: 22.08.2020\r\n\r\nToday I got the results
    from dr. Hermann. He said my sperm count and quality is perfect. There should
    be no reason for us not to get pregnant if Rose\u2019s exams are also fine. I
    must confess I can\u2019t help but thinking she doesn\u2019t want to have a child
    with me before I get my shit together. It\u2019s at the same time disappointing
    and comprehensible. But why lie to me if she really doesn\u2019t want to have
    a baby? I know she\u2019s always been very worried about her looks, sometimes
    I think she just doesn\u2019t want to gain weight and become unnatractive. That
    would be ridiculous because I would love her anyway, I\u2019m the luckiest man
    in the world to have such a hot girlfriend, but I really don\u2019t care if she
    puts on weight, even if she became paraplegic I would love her the same way,
    maybe even more. She\u2019s my Sansa, my Kate Winslet. It saddens me to think
    that she would feel like this. Maybe I should ask her about it, but at the same
    time I fear that she\u2019ll tell me that she simply doesn\u2019t want to have
    a child with me because of my difficult and fickle personality.\r\n"
