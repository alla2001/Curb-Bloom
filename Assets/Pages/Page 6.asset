  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\n\nEntry 6: 20.10.2020\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long time,
    but the last weeks have been really good. I should first of all address the pregnancy
    problem which has been a bone of contention in our relationship.\r\n\r\nShe confessed
    that she is worried about her appearance changing so much that I won\u2019t love
    her anymore and she\u2019s afraid that I\u2019ll do the same to her as her father
    did to her mother. I understand she has her traumas of abandonment and I want
    to be there for her. This is really difficult for both of us, I know that my
    personality doesn\u2019t transmit much confidence and security, but I SWEAR to
    Buddha and Allah and Zeus and Cthulhu that I will NEVER do anything to hurt her
    and will NEVER leave her under any circumstances. I understand it\u2019s difficult
    for her to believe this in her heart but I give my word that if I fail her I\u2019ll
    kill myself on the following day.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere was nothing in the world
    that I ever wanted more\r\nThan to feel you deep in my heart\r\nThere was nothing
    in the world that I ever wanted more\r\nThan to never feel the breaking apart\r\nMy
    pictures of you\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBabe, how can I prove to you what I feel?
    If you asked me to jump off a cliff I would do it right now! My past sucks. If
    I could I would erase my whole life and restart from scratch. I\u2019m thinking
    about Barbara and Victoria and how I made their lives miserable\u2026 Maybe I\u2019ll
    send them a message. It\u2019s horrible to know that I hurt people like this.
    But I\u2019m getting better, this much I know.\r\nWe went to a motel a couple
    of weeks ago to spice things up on our anniversary and it was awesome. I think
    if we do this more often she\u2019ll become more confident in our relationship,
    I would never stop having sex with her if she got fat or anything, I love her
    from the bottom of my heart because she has a beautiful soul. I hope she also
    makes up her mind about the proposal.\r\n"
