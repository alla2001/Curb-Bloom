  text: "GILLY\u2019S DIARY\n\nEntry 18: 15.08.2021\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve bought the
    house, I\u2019m really excited about spending our first vacations there. Rose
    said she wants to invite the whole family, but we need to wait until everyone
    gets vaccinated. I\u2019m very happy about it, we\u2019re gonna have such a nice
    time. My parents don\u2019t like her mother, but who does. I hope they all come
    and we enjoy the silence of the countryside. When the children arrive we\u2019re
    gonna make it regular to go over there on the weekends. I think I\u2019m finally
    finding balance in my life. Thank you so much dr. Khurana. You\u2019ve certainly
    been the most important factor in this process. I\u2019ve finished reading \u201CThe
    death of Ivan Illitch\u201D and I see precisely the message you wanted to convey.
    Just beautiful. Thank you so much.\r\n"
